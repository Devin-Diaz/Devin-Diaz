## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a 4th-year Computer Science student at Framingham State University, passionate about solving real-world problems through software. I recently completed a **Data Engineering Internship at Citizens Bank**, where I helped develop backend APIs for a metadata-driven data platform.

I'm returning as an **Incoming Data Engineer Associate at Citizens Bank**, continuing to work on backend systems, data workflows, and enterprise-scale engineering projects.
