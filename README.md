## About Me

I'm a third-year Computer Science student at Framingham State University with a passion for building reliable systems and writing clean, production-level code. I recently wrapped up an internship as a **Data Engineering Intern at Citizens Bank**, where I built backend APIs for an enterprise platform supporting ETL workflows and metadata-driven automation.

I'm returning to Citizens as an **Incoming Data Engineer Associate**, continuing to grow my skills in scalable backend systems, data workflows, and full-stack engineering.
